# Push the Box
* by: Samuel peržeľ

This is a small game that was created as a school project.
It is done in Python using tkinter library.

The code might feel a bit messy, since I am not used to publishing it, but I thought I might give it a try.

Point of the game is to move the blue box to a specific location. After this condition is met, you win the game.
Currently, the game contains only one level. It will probably stay this way, but if I'll have the time, I might do couple of more levels going from trivial to harder ones.
I was even thinking about some other mechanics such as portals, or that the reset will only apply for player and you can use that to your advantage, but those are just some ideas.
I might even make some textures so the game does not look so bland.

CONTROLS:
* WASD - movement
* R - restart

TILES INFO:
* player -> player
* blue -> box
* green -> win location
* grey -> wall
